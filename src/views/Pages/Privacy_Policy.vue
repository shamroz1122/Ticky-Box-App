            maintaining databases of those signed up to our newsletter;
            fulfilling orders for goods or services (whether placed online, over the phone or in person);

            HOW WE PROTECT DATA
            </p>
            <span class="body-2 font-weight-medium "> We employ a variety of physical and technical measures to keep your data safe and to prevent unauthorised access to, or use or disclosure of your personal information.

Our staff receive data protection training and we have a set of detailed data protection procedures which personnel are required to follow when handling personal data.

            Payment security

            STORAGE
            </p>
            <span class="body-2 font-weight-medium "> Where we store information

            Demos’ operations are based in England and we store our data within the European Union.

            How long we store information

            We will only use and store information for so long as it is required for the purposes it was collected for. How long information will be stored for depends on the information in question and what it is being used for. For example, if you ask us not to send you marketing emails, we will stop storing your emails for marketing purposes (though we’ll keep a record of your preference not to be emailed).

            We continually review what information we hold and delete what is no longer required. We never store payment card information.

            KEEPING YOU IN CONTROL
            </p>
            <span class="body-2 font-weight-medium "> We want to ensure you remain in control of your personal data. Part of this is making sure you understand your legal rights, which are as follows:

            the right to confirmation as to whether or not we have your personal data and, if we do, to obtain a copy of the personal information we hold (this is known as subject access request);
            the right to have your data erased (though this will not apply where it is necessary for us to continue to use the data for a lawful reason);
            the right to have inaccurate data rectified;
            the right to object to your data being used for marketing or profiling; and
            where technically feasible, you have the right to personal data you have provided to us which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract. This information will be provided in a common electronic format.
            Please keep in mind that there are exceptions to the rights above and, though we will always try to respond to your satisfaction, there may be situations where we are unable to do so.

            Note on compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation as pertaining to use of social media data within Demos projects
            The Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (CASM) often conducts research which involves the collection and analysis of publicly available data from social media platforms.  Much of this data, including usernames, is considered personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In order to ensure this data is processed lawfully and transparently, the following procedures are followed by CASM projects undertaken by Demos:

            All data collected from social media platforms is accessed through the official application programming interface (API) of that platform, and stored and used in compliance with that API’s terms of service.
            Data is only collected from platforms for which users have provided clear consent, as defined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR, to provide that platform with published data
            CASM often applies techniques in artificial intelligence to social media data, in order to conduct research on this data. As we have throughout our history as a research centre, we ensure that the reasons for applying these techniques, the methodology used to analyse data, and the conclusions drawn from our analysis are presented clearly and fully in each report. This includes publishing detailed accuracy scores for any machine learning algorithms applied as part of the research.
